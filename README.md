# Project Overview
This repository is for the Plot.ly assignment for the UCSD Data Bootcamp using the Plot.ly library in Javascript to create a user-end web application dashboard which dynamically react to user actions. The assignment covers the following concepts:
- Create a dashboard with user interaction/usability as a design priority
- Graph and style basic graphs using Plot.ly
- Import and filter data from external sources (e.g. JSON files)
- Using event listeners and D3.js library to dynamically update datasets that Plot.ly graphs utilize 
- Demonstrate different represenatations of data by applying data to varied chart attributes  (e.g. chart bubble's bubble size and color)
